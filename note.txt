# Vue-cli
We used the latest 3.x Vue CLI which aims to reduce project configuration to as little as possible. Almost everything is inside package.json + some other related files such as babel.config.js, .eslintrc.js and postcss.config.js

# Element-UI
Vue Material Dashboard also uses element-ui components and restyles them to achieve consistent and homogenous interface with the existing custom components and general UI of the dashboard.
